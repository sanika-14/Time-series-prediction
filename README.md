# Time-series-prediction-for-stocks
A project showcasing the use of ARIMA for predicting stock prices.
## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- pandas & numpy  
- statsmodels  
- matplotlib & seaborn  

## Working  
ARIMA helps us understand:  
- Trends: Are prices generally going up or down?  
- Seasonality: Are there regular patterns?  
- Noise: What's random and unpredictable?

## Limitations
-ARIMA struggles with datasets requiring excessive differencing or exhibiting nonlinear and seasonal patterns, often resulting in flat or inaccurate predictions. Advanced models like LSTM are better suited for such cases, as they can capture complex dynamics directly from raw data without requiring stationarity.
